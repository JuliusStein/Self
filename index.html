        <p class="bio-text">
          Currently, I am a Masters student in the Design Engineering Program at Harvard University and a Technical Assistant 
          in the Artificial Intelligence group at MIT Lincoln Laboratories. Before my current dergree, I taught Computer Science 
          to high school students in east boston through Teach for America while pursuing a Masters in Education.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        In undergrad, I studied Computer Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction, as well as Philosophy at the University of Chicago. 
        Outside of the classroom, I have also worked in software development and product design at startups in Boston and New York, 
        and taught computer science for a number of non-profits.  
        
      </p>
      <p>
        During High School, I started a non-profit called Bright Technologies which provided computers and computer hardware education to students 
        in the south side of Chicago, and while the organization is no longer active, it certainly sparked my love of teaching and my interest in 
        the potential for novel technologies to transform education and everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not working, I enjoy playing Ice Hockey for the Harvard Men's Club team, working on electronics projects in my workshop, and collecting rocks and minerals.

            ineract with through haptic feedback while a braile display renders the

            While traditional slicers allow for the stable creation of layered 3D prints,
            they do not allow for the printing of vertical columns, continuous spirals, or countless
            other geometries. This project explores the creation of a slicer that allows for prints
            to combine standard layering with continuous extrusion techniques.

            A Demographic Study. In Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Learning @

          <p class="pub-details">
            Learner data from multiple instances of two introductory Python MOOCs, offered before and during the COVID-19 
            pandemic, were analyzed to see if and how learner behavior and overall learning out- comes changed during the 
            pandemic. We found a surge in interest during the pandemic, but the certification rate fell short of the pre-pandemic 
            average. Moreover, this drop in certification rate is more noticeable for the advanced course in the sequence, and 
            is more pronounced in groups traditionally underrepresented in computer- science and coding communities. Additionally, 
            we analyzed learners’ interaction with one another on the course discussion forum, and performed a sentiment analysis of 
            the forum comments using natural language processing, which revealed behavioral trends that differed significantly during the pandemic.

              Severity and Computer Science MOOC Learner Achievement: A Preliminary Analysis. In Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S ’22),

          <p class="pub-details">
            Online education, and MOOCs in particular, experienced a dramatic rise during the COVID-19 lockdown. Many had extra time to start learning new topics, 
            while a significant fraction of the population experienced disruptions in areas such as healthcare, childcare, and potential loss of livelihood, 
            among others. In this work we analyze learner data from multiple instances of two introductory Python MOOCs, offered before and during the COVID-19 
            pandemic, to understand how the pandemic affected learner progress and outcomes in these courses. We explore multiple measures of COVID-19 severity, 
            and find a strong correlation between a measure of severity and relative change in certification rate. Specifically, we find that the change in 
            certification rate relative to pre-pandemic baselines showed a negative correlation as COVID-19 severity increased.
