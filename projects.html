            A bridge for the deafblind community to connect with the world.
            Through the combination of computer vision and audio analysis by a shirt-worn pin,
            Felt allows the deafblind to recognize the emotions of those they
            ineract with through haptic feedback while a braile display renders the 
            speech in real time.

            A data-driven analysis of the relationship between a victim's dress and

            the correlation between the presence of this language and the verdict
            is explored.

          <p class="project-details">
            While traditional slicers allow for the stable creation of layered 3D prints,
            they do not allow for the printing of vertical columns, continuous spirals, or countless
            other geometries. This project explores the creation of a slicer that allows for prints
            to combine standard layering with continuous extrusion techniques.

            Two devices atempt to harvest human power to charge a phone and light a headlamp respectively. One device
            is an insole that uses piezo-electric crystals to generate power from
            the pressure of walking. The other is a headlamp that uses a peltier
            module to generate power from the temperature difference between the
            wearer's head and the environment.

            while advancing the game 1 year. The player wins by reaching their retirement
            goal without their happiness hitting zero.

            Resistor is a puzzle-based game to teach resistor/capacitor circuits to high school physics 
            students. The player assumes the role of a bomb defuser, and each bomb is itself a resistor and capcitor circuit which the student
            defuses by achieving the proper voltage through modifying the layout and selecting new components.

            Using E. coli nissl, a sub-species of E. coli that produces cellulose when fed,
            we created a directed evolution system to select for E. coli that could consume glycerol
            instead of sugar or corn as is traditionally used. This would allow for the production of
            cellulose feedstock from waste glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production.

            As a physical design challenge, the core functionality of a Camera
            chasis was designed and 3D printed. The camera was designed to be
            modular, allowing for the components to be easily swapped out.
            The switches are bistable and the teloscopic lens utilises a set of 
            tabs to allow for lens positioning and focus.

            A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. The game
            is played on a 2D grid, and each cell is either alive or dead. Each
            turn, the state of each cell is updated based on the state of its
            neighbors. The game is played until all cells are dead or the game
            reaches a stable state.
